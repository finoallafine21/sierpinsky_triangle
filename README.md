The rules to draw the triangle by hand can be described as such:
- draw a equilateral triangle
- choose a random point inside of the triangle
- now randomly choose one of the three corner points
- draw a point in the middle between the randomly inside point and the corner
- again, draw a point in the middle of the newly created point and a random corner point 
- repeat this multiple times
- after a while you should be able to see the pattern of the Sierpinski Triangle
